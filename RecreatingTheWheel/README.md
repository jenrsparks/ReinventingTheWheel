# Recreating The Wheel

## Goals

In an attempt to hone my Java skills, I want to work my way through the core functionalities of the Java language and recreate the components, therefore becoming more intimately familiar with their performance implications, subtle differences, and where they are best put to use.

I plan to commit often, as I progress, and make excessive notes of my thinking along the way. There will likely be some substantial refactoring occurring as I consolidate functionality into common interfaces and abstract classes, though that is likely further down the road as more content is added.

## Structure

In order to make the structure of the packages easily navigable, each implementation will be located in a parallel to the Java object being re-implemented. I suspect there will be required deviations from the structure, based solely on the approach taken by myself as opposed to the Java packages, however I will make an effort to mirror them as closely as possible.
